    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "## Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation details:\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm can be split into following sub-blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Extract Region of interest to save computations.\n",
    "      - Trapezoid with base as image width and height nearly spanning till the middle of image\n",
    "      - Base width and top width were arrived at empirically\n",
    "   2. Convert to grayscale to reduce further computations\n",
    "   3. Create a mask for yellow and white areas in the image as lanes are usually demarked by white or yellow lines\n",
    "   4. Extract yellow and white areas\n",
    "   5. Extract edges from these areas using canny algorithm\n",
    "   6. Remove noise effect by blurring out canny edge image with a kernel of size 3\n",
    "   7. Find lines in this filtered image\n",
    "   8. Split the lines into left and right lanes using the slope of these lines\n",
    "   9. Fit a lane marking line passing through left and right set of lines we obtained from Hough transform\n",
    "      - I have tried linear regression to fit the line passing through all points in a particular lane\n",
    "      - Other methods could include passing a line through top and bottom points in a particular lane\n",
    "   10. Overlay the lane markings on input image\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: The algorithm informs with a print spew if it failed to detect one/both lane markings but continues to find lane markings in subsequent images\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shortcomings and Suggestions for improving this algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Output of the algorithm appears correct but not very smooth (This was the case with version 1)\n",
    "     - Average of y intercepts could be considered for smoothening out the lane markings \n",
    "     - Will be trying a second order filter to test this concept\n",
    "       (Already implemented in current version of the algorithm)\n",
    "  2. Weighted average could be considered to fit lane markings instead of linear regression. This would give more weightage to longer lines and hopefully fit the lane markings better\n",
    "  3. This implementation could also be run through a video captured in various lighting conditions to test robustness\n",
    "  4. It could also be tested in foggy climate, rains, shaded areas (as seen in challenge.mp4), wet roads. I believe the algorithm may not function very well in foggy climate and during heavy rains when the vision is blurred and occluded. It should however perform well during slight rains and on wet roads where the vision is not affected much.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the code\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code, open P1.ipynb using jupyter notebook and execute cells one after the other or all in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the execution is complete, output for test images would be created in the same folder as \"test_images/\" but with file names prepended with \"lanes_\". Please delete all files with name starting with \"lanes_\" before running the algorithm again\n",
